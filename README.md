6. We chose Perforce as our version control system. None of the team members had prior experience with Perforce before this project. 
We did not have a great experience with Perforce. I found it difficult to use and not intuitive to learn with previous experience with git.
The largest difficulties we had with Perforce came from the file locking system. At least within our understanding, once a file is locked,
there is no way to unlock it without either submitting a changelist or reverting the file. If there are local changes this can be difficult.
We also experienced that the  file locking system will not prevent a user from submitting changes to that file, but the file will not be changed.
This caused some serious distruption at one point during our project where I myself pushed changes that ended up not compiling for all other members of our team.
The biggest problem with this was that perforce gave me no warning that this file would be overwritten. From my end, everything seemed fine.
I also personally had a hard time adjusting to the P4v interface. I know there is command line tool, but since the rest of my team was using
the editor I felt it maded more senes to work in the same environment as them.  I know not everyone prefers the command line, but in my personal
experience with git the command line is far easier to work with and understand.
